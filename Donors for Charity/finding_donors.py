# ## Getting Started
# 
# In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. 
# 
# The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.

# ----
# ## Exploring the Data
# Run the code cell below to load necessary Python libraries and load the census data. Note that the last column from this dataset, `'income'`, will be our target label (whether an individual makes more than, or at most, $50,000 annually). All other columns are features about each individual in the census database.

display(data.head(n=10))


# ### Implementation: Data Exploration
# A cursory investigation of the dataset will determine how many individuals fit into either group, and will tell us about the percentage of these individuals making more than \$50,000. In the code cell below, you will need to compute the following:
# - The total number of records, `'n_records'`
# - The number of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'n_greater_50k'`.
# - The number of individuals making at most \$50,000 annually, `'n_at_most_50k'`.
# - The percentage of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'greater_percent'`.
# 
# ** HINT: ** You may need to look at the table above to understand how the `'income'` entries are formatted.

# TODO: Total number of records
n_records = len(data.index)

# TODO: Number of records where individual's income is more than $50,000

# TODO: Number of records where individual's income is at most $50,000

# TODO: Percentage of individuals whose income is more than $50,000
greater_percent = float(n_greater_50k)/ n_records*100.00

# Print the results
print "Total number of records: {}".format(n_records)
print "Individuals making more than $50,000: {}".format(n_greater_50k)
print "Individuals making at most $50,000: {}".format(n_at_most_50k)

# ----
# ## Preparing the Data
# Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured â€” this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms.

# ### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features
# A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. 
# 
# Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed.

# In[3]:


# Split the data into features and target label
income_raw = data['income']
features_raw = data.drop('income', axis = 1)

# Visualize skewed continuous features of original data
vs.distribution(data)


# For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.
# 
# Run the code cell below to perform a transformation on the data and visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are distributed. 

# In[4]:


# Log-transform the skewed features
skewed = ['capital-gain', 'capital-loss']
features_log_transformed = pd.DataFrame(data = features_raw)
features_log_transformed[skewed] = features_raw[skewed].apply(lambda x: np.log(x + 1))

# Visualize the new log distributions
vs.distribution(features_log_transformed, transformed = True)


# ### Normalizing Numerical Features
# In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.
# 
# Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this.

# In[5]:


# Import sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Initialize a scaler, then apply it to the features
scaler = MinMaxScaler() # default=(0, 1)
numerical = ['age', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week']

features_log_minmax_transform = pd.DataFrame(data = features_log_transformed)
features_log_minmax_transform[numerical] = scaler.fit_transform(features_log_transformed[numerical])

# Show an example of a record with scaling applied
display(features_log_minmax_transform.head(n = 5))
                                          


# ### Implementation: Data Preprocessing
# 
# From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _"dummy"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.
# 
# |   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |
# | :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |
# | 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
# | 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |
# | 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |
# 
# Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label ("<=50K" and ">50K"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.
#  - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.
#    - Set records with "<=50K" to `0` and records with ">50K" to `1`.

# In[6]:


# TODO: One-hot encode the 'features_log_minmax_transform' data using pandas.get_dummies()
features_final = pd.get_dummies(features_raw)

# TODO: Encode the 'income_raw' data to numerical values
income = income_raw.map(lambda x: 0 if x == "<=50K" else 1)

# Print the number of features after one-hot encoding
encoded = list(features_final.columns)
print "{} total features after one-hot encoding.".format(len(encoded))

# Uncomment the following line to see the encoded feature names
print encoded


# ### Shuffle and Split Data
# Now all _categorical variables_ have been converted into numerical features, and all numerical features have been normalized. As always, we will now split the data (both features and their labels) into training and test sets. 80% of the data will be used for training and 20% for testing.
# 
# Run the code cell below to perform this split.

# In[7]:


# Import train_test_split
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split

# Split the 'features' and 'income' data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_final, 
                                                    income, 
                                                    test_size = 0.2, 
                                                    random_state = 0)

# Show the results of the split
print "Training set has {} samples.".format(X_train.shape[0])
print "Testing set has {} samples.".format(X_test.shape[0])

# ## Evaluating Model Performance
# In this section, we will investigate four different algorithms, and determine which is best at modeling the data. Three of these algorithms will be supervised learners of your choice, and the fourth algorithm is known as a *naive predictor*.

# ### Metrics and the Naive Predictor
# *CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:
# 
# $$ F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{precision \cdot recall}{\left( \beta^2 \cdot precision \right) + recall} $$
# 
# In particular, when $\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).
# 
# Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *"this person does not make more than \$50,000"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. 
# 
# 
# #### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall
# 
# ** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. Itâ€™s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).
# 
# ** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.
# It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of
# 
# `[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`
# 
# ** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.
# It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of
# 
# `[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`
# 
# For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios).

# ### Question 1 - Naive Predictor Performace
# * If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `'accuracy'` and `'fscore'` to be used later.
# 
# ** HINT: ** 
# 
# * When we have a model that always predicts '1' (i.e. the individual makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives(TN) or False Negatives(FN) as we are not making any negative('0' value) predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. 
# * Our Recall score(True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)) in this setting becomes 1 as we have no False Negatives.

# In[8]:


from __future__ import division

TP = np.sum(income) # Counting the ones as this is the naive case. Note that 'income' is the 'income_raw' data encoded to numerical values done in the data preprocessing step.
FP = income.count() - TP # Specific to the naive case

TN = 0 # No predicted negatives in the naive case
FN = 0 # No predicted negatives in the naive case

sumP = TP + FP
# TODO: Calculate accuracy, precision and recall
accuracy = TP/sumP
recall = 1.0
precision = TP/sumP
beta = 0.5

# TODO: Calculate F-score using the formula above for beta = 0.5 and correct values for precision and recall.
# HINT: The formula above can be written as (1 + beta**2) * (precision * recall) / ((beta**2 * precision) + recall)
fscore = (1 + beta**2) * (precision * recall) / ((beta**2 * precision) + recall)

# Print the results 
print "Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: {:.4f}, F-score: {:.4f}]".format(accuracy, fscore)


# ###  Supervised Learning Models
# **The following are some of the supervised learning models that are currently available in** [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) **that you may choose from:**
# - Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
# - Decision Trees
# - Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
# - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
# - Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
# - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
# - Logistic Regression

# ### Question 2 - Model Application
# List three of the supervised learning models above that are appropriate for this problem that you will test on the census data. For each model chosen
# 
# - Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. 
# - What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?
# - What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?
# - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?
# 
# ** HINT: **
# 
# Structure your answer in the same format as above^, with 4 parts for each of the three models you pick. Please include references with your answer.

# **Answer: The three supervised learning classifiers that I choose are Naive Bayes, DecisionTree and Support Vector machines.** 

# # Naive Bayes Classifier

# * **Usage** The classifer is used to detect spam emails, classifying articles as a category such as google now cards, and sometimes in  sentiment analysis.
# -
# * **Strengths** The classifier performs well when the features are independent from each other  - 
# - Simple to run and implement
# - Good at handling large spaces, parameters and features
# - Training speed is fast compared to others
# - low variance so hard to overfit
# - Small memory footprint
# -
# * **Weakness** The classifier performs poorly when the class labels and the corresponding attributes are not together  - 
# - Easily breakable
# - If no class label and attribute together, then the estimated probability will be 0
# - Small amount of data can add bias, which inturn underfits the data
# *
# * **What makes it a good candidate?**
# - The data has many features and dummy variables after one-hot encoding. The naive bayes classifier is exceptinally good at handling large amount of features and data. This is a good classifier for this dataset.

# - https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/datamine.111/b28129/algo_nb.htm#DMCON018

# # Support Vector Machine

# * **Usage** SVMs are used in a variety of cases such as image and writing recognition, medical usage to detect a disease and weather/stock predictions
#  
# * **Strengths** The classifier performs well when there are two different classes that can be finitely differentiated
# - The SVM has a regularisation parameter which helps avoid overfitting.
# - It has kernels that help it classify non-linear, complex data
# - It is fast when it comes to training
# * **Weakness** The classifier does not perform well when the given data has multiple classes or in other words, if the data in not binary
# - Only considers "support vectors" instead of the whole dataset
# - Choosing appropriate hyperparameters and kernels can be tricky
# - Testing can be slow
# -
# * **What makes it a good candidate?**
# - The dataset is a binary classification problem since we have to predict incomes above or below 50K. SVMs are good at binary classifications.
# 
# * **WORKS CITED** 
# - http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6914146/
# 

# # Decision Tree Classifier

# * **Usage** This classifier has been used vastly in speech recognition and chatbots. Since chatbots use a series of questions to get to a solution, they make a great candidate for simple speech recognition chatbots.
# * **Strengths** The classifier will perform well when the features are binary and less dimensions so that it can build a smaller tree. The classifier can be used for multiclass classification.
# - Non-parametric that means one does not worry about if the data is linearly seperable or not.
# - Fast trainig speed
# - No distribution required
# * **Weakness** The classifier does not perform well when there are a lot of classes and the tree grows too quickly which inturn overfits the data
# - Can easily overfit
# - Can easily get stuck at local minima
# - Can be biased towards one specific class if it occurs many times compared to other features
# * **What makes it a good candidate**
# - Most of the classification done here is binary. It is easy to visualize binary classification using decision trees. The tree also is good a accuartely predicting since it has to go through every step in detail to reach a certain conclusion.

# ### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline
# To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).
#  - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.
#  - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.
#    - Record the total prediction time.
#  - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.
#  - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.
#    - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!

    # Return the results
    return results


# ### Implementation: Initial Model Evaluation
# In the code cell, you will need to implement the following:
# - Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.
# - Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.
#   - Use a `'random_state'` for each model you use, if provided.
#   - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model â€” you will tune one specific model in a later section.
# - Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.
#   - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.
# 
# **Note:** Depending on which algorithms you chose, the following implementation may take some time to run!

# ## Improving Results
# In this final section, you will choose from the three supervised learning models the *best* model to use on the student data. You will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F-score. 

# ### Question 3 - Choosing the Best Model
# 
# * Based on the evaluation you performed earlier, in one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML* which of the three models you believe to be most appropriate for the task of identifying individuals that make more than \$50,000. 
# 
# ** HINT: ** 
# Look at the graph at the bottom left from the cell above(the visualization created by `vs.evaluate(results, accuracy, fscore)`) and check the F score for the testing set when 100% of the training set is used. Which model has the highest score? Your answer should include discussion of the:
# * metrics - F score on the testing when 100% of the training data is used, 
# * prediction/training time
# * the algorithm's suitability for the data.

# **Answer: **
# 
# * **Training Set**
# - Looking at the training set, the model that took the longest to train by looking only at the data(graph) is SVM compared GaussianNB or DecisionTreeClassifier. Moving on to the second graph, the DecisionTreeClassifier has the highest accuracy at 1.0 followed by SVM at 0.8 and GaussianNB at 0.6. The DecisionTree performed well on the training set in terms of accuracy. When it comes to F-score of the training set, the decision tree seems to outperform both, the svm and gaussianNB. Overall, the best performer on the training set is the decision tree classifier.
# 
# - Generally speaking, GaussianNB and DT Classifier take about the same amount of time to train. Looking at the results, they turned out as predicted. One more thing to notice is that the accuracy and the F-score of the Decision Tree classifier decreased as the percentage of the data trained on increased.
# 
# * **Testing Set**
# - Looking at the graphs for the testing set, SVM had a better accuracy and F-score. The testing is set is important in this situation as the model is responding well to new data compared to the other models. The graphs show that the predictions of the SVMs are influenced by the size of the data. The SVM performs well when there is a lot of data but fails when only 1% - 10% of the data is presented where as other models have performed well. However, in this situation, the complete training set is available and the SVM outperforms the other models.

# ### Question 4 - Describing the Model in Layman's Terms
# 
# * In one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML*, in layman's terms, how the final model chosen is supposed to work. Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using advanced mathematical jargon, such as describing equations.

# **Answer:Suport Vector Machines** 
# 
# **Scenario:** Suppose we are investigating a certain disease in a patient and want to figure out if the person has that disease or not. The given information are a set of symptoms the patient is experienceing, past records/symptoms of patients who had the disease and the past records of the patients who did not have the disease. The objective of the experiment is to decide if the patient has the disease(1) or no(0) only using the given information. Looking at the problem, it is a classification problem and we can use support vector machines to help us solve it.

# **Support Vector machine.** The objective of support vector machines is to draw a boundry line (aka hyperplane) that best seperates two differen classes. In this case, we want the svm to draw a line that best seperates the patients who have the disease and the patients who don't given that both the groups have certain symptoms. One factor to consider is space beside the line.
# 
# **What are support vectors?**
# - Support vectors are data points the algorithm considers into account when drawing the hyperplane. The data points consist of both the classes. The way the points are picked such that, when the best boundry(hyperplane) is drawn, it has maximum amount of space beside it. For example, in the image above, the green line is the boundry line and the space beside it on both sides is what that should be maximized. The blue data points represent the patients who did not have the disease and the red represent the patients with the disease.
# 
# **The Hyperplane**
#  - The best way to visualize this is to think of the whole system as a road system where the hyperplane/the boundry line is the lane divider, support vectors as houses, the space between them as the road and the margins as guuters. The objective here is to maximize the road/lanes for both sides of the traffic without moving the houses(support vectors) while the gutters pass below the houses (in other words, we want the gutters to pass below the houses so that the stuff from the bathrooms drain down into the gutter.)
#  
#  The image below describes the process of maximizing the margin and touching many support vectors as opposed to just two.

# ### Implementation: Model Tuning
# Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
# - Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).
# - Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.
#  - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.
# - Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.
#  - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.
#  - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!
# - Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\beta = 0.5$).
# - Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.
# - Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.
# 
# **Note:** Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list, the following implementation may take some time to run!

print "Final F-score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5))


# ### Question 5 - Final Model Evaluation
# 
# * What is your optimized model's accuracy and F-score on the testing data? 
# * Are these scores better or worse than the unoptimized model? 
# * How do the results from your optimized model compare to the naive predictor benchmarks you found earlier in **Question 1**?_  
# 
# **Note:** Fill in the table below with your results, and then provide discussion in the **Answer** box.

# #### Results:
# 
# |     Metric     | Benchmark Predictor | Unoptimized Model | Optimized Model |
# | :------------: | :-----------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: | 
# | Accuracy Score |    0.2478                 |          0.8371         |   0.8381             |
# | F-score        |    0.2917                |          0.6745         |   0.6777     |
# 

# **Answer: ** The scores of the optimized model extremely were worse than the scores of the unoptimized model. The difference in accuracy scores (unoptimized - optimized) is 0.3594 and the difference in F-score is 0.3473. Although both th emodels did better than the benchmark predictors, the optimized model was not much different than them. Overall, the scores of the unoptimized model was better.

# ## Feature Importance
# 
# An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \$50,000.
# 
# Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset.

# ### Question 6 - Feature Relevance Observation
# When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?

# **Answer:**
# 
# - **Rank 5 - Sex - **
# As much as one hates to consider one's gender to determine their salary, the reality is that, males earn more than females and that is something that needs to change and should be equaled. A study published by AAUW, the research shows that males earn close to 20% more. - Although all of this is not related to this project, it is important since in reality it is a factor that impacts a person's pay. 
# - **Rank 4 - Occupation - **
# The type of job one has does have an impact on the amount of money they make. Some jobs pay more than others and some don't. Some jobs pay promotional amount and some pay by the hour while some pay by te month.
# - **Rank 3 - Work class** 
# The type of work-class is also very important. If one is self-employed they might be making less or more than someone who has a government post and maybe someone who has a private job might be making more than someone who is self-employed.
# - **Rank 2 - Hours per week**
# The amount of hours worked every week basically determines the total amount for the year. A lot of jobs pay by the hour so considering that  one needs to have be earning geater than 50K, hours per week are every important
# - **Rank 1 - Education level**
# Finally, in the real world, one's education level determines if one will get a job or not, what type of job, and what kind of position (manager, developer etc). Ultimately, in most cases, your education lev el decides your salaray. No, this is not always true. Some cases can include running an online business, entertainment careers such as YouTube do not necessarily need an education level.

# ### Implementation - Extracting Feature Importance
# Choose a `scikit-learn` supervised learning algorithm that has a `feature_importance_` attribute availble for it. This attribute is a function that ranks the importance of each feature when making predictions based on the chosen algorithm.
# 
# In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Import a supervised learning model from sklearn if it is different from the three used earlier.
#  - Train the supervised model on the entire training set.
#  - Extract the feature importances using `'.feature_importances_'`.

# In[15]:


# TODO: Import a supervised learning model that has 'feature_importances_'
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier

# TODO: Train the supervised model on the training set using .fit(X_train, y_train)
model = AdaBoostClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# TODO: Extract the feature importances using .feature_importances_ 
importances = model.feature_importances_

# Plot
vs.feature_plot(importances, X_train, y_train) 




# ### Question 7 - Extracting Feature Importance
# 
# Observe the visualization created above which displays the five most relevant features for predicting if an individual makes at most or above \$50,000.  
# * How do these five features compare to the five features you discussed in **Question 6**?
# * If you were close to the same answer, how does this visualization confirm your thoughts? 
# * If you were not close, why do you think these features are more relevant?

# **Answer:**
# 
# The features that I selected and the five features here have two in common, hours per week and education. Here, both the featurs have a low feature weight but a very high cumulative weight. Looking at the graph, hours per week and education are ranked side by side (2 and 1). This is the same case with my ranking, where i ranked hours per week 2 and education 1. I did not have the same features as the ones above with only 2 common. I think that age is a huge factor since it decides one's capability of working. Capital loss and gain are also very important since they are linked to one's financial status and assets.

# ### Feature Selection
# How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower â€” at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. 

# In[16]:


# Import functionality for cloning a model
from sklearn.base import clone

# Reduce the feature space
X_train_reduced = X_train[X_train.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]
X_test_reduced = X_test[X_test.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]

# Train on the "best" model found from grid search earlier
clf = (clone(best_clf)).fit(X_train_reduced, y_train)

# Make new predictions
reduced_predictions = clf.predict(X_test_reduced)

# Report scores from the final model using both versions of data
print "Final Model trained on full data\n------"
print "Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions))
print "F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5))
print "\nFinal Model trained on reduced data\n------"
print "Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, reduced_predictions))
print "F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, reduced_predictions, beta = 0.5))


# ### Question 8 - Effects of Feature Selection
# 
# * How does the final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced data using only five features compare to those same scores when all features are used?
# * If training time was a factor, would you consider using the reduced data as your training set?

# **Answer:** The F-score of the reduced data is lower than the F-score of the full data. The difference betweeen the F-scores is 0.1442. This is not a huge difference can be very expensive if the data set was to much larger with many features. The difference in accuracy score is 0.0438, which also is inexpensive but could be drastic dedpending on the data set. Although only 5 features were used, the reduction costed a lot, especially on the F- Score. The accuracy particularly is not extremely poor, but still expensive.
# 
# If time was a factor, I would not reduce the data, atleast for this particular classifier as the results were unsatisfactory compared to the full data model. If another classification model was to give better scores on the reduced data, then reduction would be the better way.
